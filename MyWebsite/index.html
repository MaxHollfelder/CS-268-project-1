				<p> <big> About The Fan Page  </big></p>
				<p>This Fan Page was created by Max Hollfelder for a close friend who loves to watch and keep up with the team. They found that if they wanted a bunch of information about the Bucks they would have a go to do a bunch of different googles and would have to visit more than one site. They wanted one place to go so that they would have a plethera of information about the Bucks so that is what this page it! In addition to information about the Bucks I also wanted this to be a page that Fans could interact with on another. As you can see from the top navigation bar there are sections called Fan Chat and Fan Polling. Fan Chat right now is not at its full functionality, but it still gives fans who visit the page places to look in order to interact with other Fans and the Bucks community. Fan Polling is a page that Fans can vote on certain questions that are posted. I hope that all of you who visit this page enjoy the content within and the interactions that you can make with other fans. </p>
