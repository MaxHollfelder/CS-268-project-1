				<h1>The start if it all</h1>
				<p> It all started on January 22 in 1968, the National Basketball Association (NBA) awarded the franchise to a group of investors based in Milwaukee Wisconsin. The investers where headed by Wesley D. Pavalon and Marvin L. Fishman can called themselves the Milwaukee Professional Sports and Services, Inc. Once incorporated Milwaukee Pro was registered with the Wisconsin Department of Securities for the sale of 300,000 shares of common stock to Wisconsin residents at $5 a share. The shares were a hot commodity and additional 125,000 shares were offered later that year. The newly made bucks created there team through college and expansion drafts and whithin three years of the franchises creation it won its first and only championship (1971).
				</p>
				<h1>Arenas</h1>
				<p> Milwaukee Arena/MECCA Arena (1968-1988), This was the Millwaukee bucks first arena that they played in. The MECCA arena opened in 1950, aptly name MECCA which stands for Milwauke Exposition, Convention Center and Arena. It was Home to no only the Milwauke bucks but also Marquette University's men's basketball team and the Milwaukee Admirals (an international Hockey league team). The stadium was known for its uniquely painted court by Robert Indiana in 1978 that had large orange 'M's taking up both half-courts representing Milwaukee. After the moving out of the Millwaukee bucks and other sports teams that were using the MECCA the University of Wisconsin Madison has been using the arean to host sporting events and venues.
				</p>
				<p>Bradley Center (1988-2018), This was the second arena that the Millwakee bucks called home and was built right next to the MECCA. Opening in 1988 the arena was not intended to be the home of the Millwakee Bucks basketball team, its initial purpose was to be an arena so that an NHL expansion team could land in Millwakee However that never happened and the Millwakee turned it into there home arena. The Arena saw a lot of Millwakee bucks basketball and had a capacity of around 17,000. In 2013 the deputy NBA and now current NBA commissioner Adam Silver visited the Bradley center and deamed it unbefitting of an NBA team, stating that it was a few thousand square feet short of NBA standards and also lacked numerous amenities. After seeing this the NBA issued a mandate requiring the bucks to relocate, or be close to completion of a new facility by 2017.
				</p>
				<p> This brings us into the Fiserv Forum era and current home arean of the Millwakee Bucks. Again the Millwakee Bucks arena successor would be built right next to its predecessor. The Fiser Forum started being contructed in June of 2016 and finished two years later on August 26th 2018. The Fourm is a state of art building that ended up costing around 524 million dollars to contruct and can hold around 17,000 occupants.

				<h1>Logos</h1>
				<p>The Millwakee Bucks have gone through a couple for different logos since they started. This original logo was of a buck sitting on the word 'Millwakee Bucks' spinning a baketball on his hoof and wearing a sweater with the letter B on it. This Logo Lasted from that start of the franchise in 1968 to 1993.
				</p>
				<p> The next Bucks logo was introduced in 1993 and was quite different from the original logo made in 1968. This logo came out following the 25th anniversary season and depicted an aggressive head on view of a buck and a interesting color scheme of hunter green, purple and silver. This logo lasted from 1993-2006.
				</p>
				<p>In 2006 the Millwakee bucks showed off there new Logo... kinda. With very little changes the new logo used the exact same buck and back triangle as the old logo. The only things changes about the logo was the text font and the color scheme which changes to green, red, white. This logo lasted from 2006-2015
				</p>
				<p> The newest and current Millwaukee Bucks logo has a developed story behind its changes in a attemped to rebrand the franchise as an imposing figure determined and focused on the path forward. Several features of the new logo chronicle the transformation of the team into an undeniable force:
					<ul>
					 <li> An expanded rack (from 8 to 12 points) showing the maturation of the Buck, and underlining the point that he has become an even greater force.</li>
					 <li>The basketball feature in the negative space between the antlers.</li>
					 <li>The M Shape within the chest chevron as an homage to Milwaukee</li>
					 <li>With hard edges that appear almost cut from metal, and industrial but classic proprietary font juxtaposed against the curvature of the logo represents a symbolic union of urban and rural Wisconsin.</li>
				 </ul>
