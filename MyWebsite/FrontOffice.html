		<p> There are a lot of people who are part of the Bucks ownership group However there are four individuals who make up the largest stakes in the team. Individuals are Wes Edens, Marc Lasry, Jamies Dinan, and Mike Fascitelli. In 2014 The Milwaukee Bucks were looking for new owners who would be willing to spend money and create a team the the City would be proud of and rally around. Because of this they we pleased to welcome in two new big inverster Wed Edens and Marc Lasry. Edens and Lasry are hedge fund billionaires and ended up buying the Milwaukee Bucks from $550 Millon and also gained the support of Dinan and Fascitelli. Another owner that I thought was worth noteing is Aaron Rodgers, Rodgers is a Quarterback for the Green Bay Packer a National Football League player Located in Wisconsin and is a very popular figure in Wisconsin. Although Aaron Rodgers does not own a huge part of the Milwaukee Bucks at only 1% fans of sports in the state still liked seeing him becomeing an owner.
